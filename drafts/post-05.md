Why or how no one knows, but a biblical-level curse has descended upon the cast and crew of the Melania Trump documentary “Melania,” who are dropping like flies, or worse.

The following is an abbreviated list of freak Melania-related tragedies to date:

Friends of Brett Rattner say the disgraced “Melania” director gorged himself to death on imported mango a week after the film was shown to his parents.

Hervé Pierre (stylist to the stars) fell into a deep catatonia from which he periodically awakes screaming in mortal terror.

Tony Neiman, the film’s composer, has lost his hearing.

Editor Alex Márquez disappeared in a West LA Sam’s Club, and was later found on a nearby street unaware of who is was or where he lived. He later jumped off a bridge.

Various other crew members are reporting baffling syndromes. “Ralph” (name withheld), who worked in post-production, told reporters he now identifies as the tennis superstar Vitus Gerulaitis.

“Mira,” a caterer, is plagued by morbid synaesthesia. When she sees a picture of her fiancé, for instance, she smells the color yellow.

Meanwhile, actor John Voigt’s corpse (Make Hollywood Great again) was found in an empty movie theater in Wrench, Montana, three days after he expired during a personal screening of the movie. During the autopsy, a scarab beetle crawled out of his mouth.

The list goes on.

The curse hasn’t stopped elderly female viewers from places like Boris, Arizona, from flooding empty theaters throughout the Southwest and beyond in support of Flotius [sic].

If only Mike Judge had this kind of support when “Idiocracy” hit the theaters twenty years ago. And he’d made a whole movie about them.
